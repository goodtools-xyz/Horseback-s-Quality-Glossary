# Horseback's Quality Glossary
#### As a Supplement of [ISO9000](http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=45481) & [ASQ Quality Glossary](http://asq.org/glossary/)

# Why I creat this project?
ASQ(American Society for Quality) published a sound  [ASQ Quality Glossary](http://asq.org/glossary/),but this version had been published for almost 10 years.I had to say ,this is a perfect work that list most of quality terminology in the quality daily work.But as a quality practicer and fans.During I diving into the quality management standard [ISO 9001](http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=62085),lots of words can't be found and clearly understood in use.The challenge comes from multi-aspect as below:
* ISO 9001 is just a general QMS standard but in practice the world is stepping ahead to the R&D acitivities and focus on the promotion  of prodoctivity and efficiency,cloud-base industrie 4.0 and the old ISO 9001 still a much more suitable standard to manufacture AND hardware but not R&D AND pure-sofeware organization,in this area,[CMMI](http://cmmiinstitute.com/resources) is much more proffesional,so I intend to add more R&D AND Software&IT terminology to solve the understanding the application in the ISO9000 as a supplement.
* There are so many closely terminology emergent in the practice during we work.such as the group of ( purchase,procurement,acquisition),I try to solve and explain in this supplement glossary.

Everyone would be welcome to engage in this project.I plan to make this project under MIT license and make more  Quality guy to engage in.If u hava interest in,just via the below path to get in touch with me.
